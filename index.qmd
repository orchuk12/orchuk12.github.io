## About

<div id="about-me">
Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master of Business Analytics at Monash University, and I thrive in leadership roles, often becoming the glue that keeps the team cohesive and motivated. With my dynamic communication skills and a knack for building strong connections, I naturally find myself networking and creating meaningful relationships with peers and colleagues alike.

I bring nearly four years of R-coding experience, blending it seamlessly with other technical proficiencies like dashboarding in Power BI, Tableau, and RShiny. My passion lies in harnessing data to tackle big challenges, particularly in areas that ignites my curiosity and drive, like: 

- Energy, water, infrastructure
- Healthcare
- Education and academia 

I'm always excited to connect and collaborate on innovative projects that make a real-world impact! Please get in touch through my contact details below.
