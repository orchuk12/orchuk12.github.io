::: {#hero-heading}

I am a current student at Monash University and I'm currently pursuing my Master of Business Analytics. I strive in taking the lead in projects and being the glue that sticks the team together, paired with my eager and comforting communication skills, I often find myself networking and enjoying the company of all my peers. 

I have an extensive background in R-coding with nearly 4 years of experience in academia which I am able to combine along with several other technical skills such as dashboarding using Power Bi, Tableau, and RShiny.  

My personal areas of interest are:

1) Energy, water, infrastructure
2) Healthcare data
3) Education sector
